## Text Classifier using BERT for Sentiment Analysis

- This project is a text classifier that uses DistilBERT (a distilled version of BERT) to classify text into sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral)

- DistilBERT is a smaller and faster version of BERT that has been pre-trained on the same corpus, so it can still learn the contextual relationships between words while being more efficient.
